# awesome-terminal-hacks
A repository consisting of useful commands required in daily tasks to reduce stackoverflow searches. 

Just click on the right of the codeblock to copy the command and use it directly in your work. 

## Task 

#### Find the list of all extensions in a folder and subdirectories.
``` 
find . -type f | perl -ne 'print $1 if m/\.([^.\/]+)$/' | sort -u
```

#### Find the list of all extensions in a folder and its subdirectories with counts 
```
find . -type f | sed -e 's/.*\.//' | sed -e 's/.*\///' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn
```
Alternate command for symlinks too
```
find . -type d -exec echo dirs \; -o -type l -exec echo symlinks \; -o -type f -links +1 -exec echo hardlinks \; -o -type f -exec echo files \; | sort | uniq -c
```

#### Find files greater than a particular size in linux
```
 find . -type f -size +4G
```

#### find files less than a particular size in Linux
```
find . -type f -size -4G
```

#### NVIDIA command - check the GPU resource usages
```
nvidia-smi && nvidia-smi pmon -c 1 | awk -F ' ' '{print $2}' | xargs -0 > t1 && export i=0; export l2="-"; while IFS='' read -r line;do if [[ "$i" -lt 2 || -z "$line" || "$line" == $l2 ]];then echo $i; else ps -p "$line" -o pid,vsz=MEMORY -o user,group=GROUP -o comm,args=ARGS | awk '{for ( x=1 ; x<=1 ; x++ ) { printf("%s\t",$x) } for (x=2;x<=2;x++) { if(NR>1) { printf("%13.2fMb\t",hr=$x/1024) } else { printf("\t%s\t",$x) } } for ( x=3 ; x<=NF ; x++ ) { printf("%s ",$x) } print "" }'; fi; i=$((i+1)) ;done < t1 && rm t1
```

#### NVIDIA command - Fix `Failed to initialize NVML: Driver/library version mismatch`
Please note, this command requires `sudo` and *will kill all processes using the GPU*.
```
# Kill all processes using the GPU
sudo lsof | grep /dev/nvidia | awk '{print $2}' | xargs -r kill
# Give processes a moment to terminate
sleep 1
# Forcibly kill processes
sudo lsof | grep /dev/nvidia | awk '{print $2}' | xargs -r kill -9
# Unload old kernel modules (drivers)
sudo rmmod nvidia_uvm nvidia_drm nvidia_modeset nvidia
# New kernel modules will automatically reload
nvidia-smi
```

#### Perform operation on all files in a path -- example here is to remove _ from filenames
```
for FILENAME in *; do FILENAME1=${FILENAME#*_}; mv $FILENAME $FILENAME1; done 
```
Note - this above for loop can be used to do many stuff accordingly. Useful to have this in mind

#### Swap columns in a file - can be modified as per your needs
```
awk 'BEGIN{FS=OFS=","}{$0=$2 FS $2 FS $1}1' <your comma delimited file>
```
Note - read awk documentation to perform lots of crazy commmands based on the above template. Learn awk - its very useful nifty tool and no installation needed on any Linux OS. 

#### Copy fastest using tar
```
tar cf - * | mbuffer -m 1024M | ssh user@host '(cd /home/path; tar xf -)'
```

#### Copy fast using rsync with OSX
```
rsync -rltv --progress --human-readable --delete --iconv=utf-8-mac,utf-8 -e 'ssh -T -c aes128-gcm@openssh.com -o Compression=no -x' <local_mac_source> <remote_linux_dest>
```
```
rsync -rtvvv --numeric-ids --delete --progress -e 'ssh -T -c aes128-gcm@openssh.com -o Compression=no -x'  <serve> <local>
```
```

```

#### Copy k files from one folder to another (assumes you are running command from current folder)
```
find . -maxdepth 1 -type f | head -k | xargs cp -t <destination folder>
```

#### Extract wav audio files form an mp4 extension of video - crude way - more customization is possible. 
```
for f in *.mp4;do ffmpeg -i "$f" "${f%mp4}wav";done
```

#### Replace spaces with underscores -- very irritating to handle spaces in filenames -- easy tool to fix that so your code doesnt need to handle. 
```
for file in */*; do echo $file; mv "$file" $(echo $file | sed 's/ /_/g'); done
```

#### Quickly get sum of a file consisting of numbers 
```
awk 'BEGIN {FS=" "};{sum+=$NF} END {print sum}' <your file>
```

#### Common lines between 2 files in Linux
```
comm -12 <(sort file1) <(sort file2)
```
```
grep -Fxf file1 file2
```
both grep and comm has same execution time roughly for relatively small txt files less than 50mb. Post that grep is better for larger files. 

#### Get Lines unique to file1 in linux
```
comm -23 <(sort file1) <(sort file2)
```

#### Get lines unique to file2 in linux
```
comm -13 <(sort file1) <(sort file2)
```
Ignore case in comm command by passing comm -i 

#### Get unique lines in your file (sort if not sorted)
```
sort file1 | uniq 
```

#### Get number of times unique lines appear in a file (sort if not sorted)
```
sort file1 | uniq -c 
```

#### Only print the repeated lines once in a file. (sort if not sorted) (basically count > 1 lines)
```
sort file1 | uniq -d 
```

#### Only print the lines which are not repeated in a file. (sort if not sorted) (basically count == 1 lines)
```
sort file1 | uniq -u
```

#### Run uniq command on a given field (below command will run uniq only field 1 - useful in delimited files)
```
uniq -f 1 file1 
```
Note: above command is sample and can be used with previous commands in combination to get what you want from a particular field. 

#### View range of lines from a file
```
sed -n '1,5p' file1
```

#### View full file except range from a file
```
sed '3,10d' file1
```

#### View non consecutive lines and ranges from a file - example below shows line 2-4 and 8-12
```
sed -n -e '2,4p' -e '8,12p' file1
```

#### Replace word1 by word2 in a file (use -i to overwrite file)
```
sed 's/word1/word2/g' file1
```
To ignore case of replacement
```
sed 's/word1/word2/gi' file1
```

### Rename all files in directory - Removes .wav for example in below
```
for i in `ls`; do echo $i; new_name=`echo $i | sed s/.wav//`; echo $new_name; mv $i $new_name; done
```

#### Replace word1 by word2 in a range in a file - example for 5-10 lines replacement
```
sed '5,10 s/word1/word2/g' file1
```

#### dos2unix (if not available) - convert file format for unix with sed
```
sed -i 's/\r//' file1
```

#### In place replacement for word1 by word 2 with sed and backing up original 
```
sed -i'.orig' 's/word1/word2/gi' file1
```

#### Replace word1 by word2 only if word3 present in line - with sed
```
sed '/word3/ s/word1/word2/g' file1
```

#### Multiple substitutions in sed - inplace example
```
sed -i 's/word1/word2/gi;s/word3/word4/gi' file1
```

#### Print specific fields from a commands output - who can be any other command
```
who | awk '{print $1, $2}'
```

#### Omit fields when printing from a file into terminal
```
awk -F":" '{$2="";$3="";print}' file1
```

#### Remove empty lines from a file in linux
```
awk '/^[ \t]*$/{next}{print}' file1
```

#### Get number of lines different between two files
```
diff -y --suppress-common-lines file1 file2 | wc -l
```

#### Get number of fields on each line in a file
```
awk '{print NR,"-->",NF}' file1
```

#### Print all lines greater than a given length - in a file/echoed output
```
echo "Some long string...." | awk 'length($0) > 5'
```

#### Get word frequency in a document using awk
```
awk 'BEGIN {FS="[^a-zA-Z]+" } { for (i=1; i<=NF; i++) words[tolower($i)]++ } END { for (i in words) print i, words[i] }' file1
```

#### Rename all files in a path with awk - example *.WAV to *.wav
```
ls *.WAV | awk '{ printf("mv \"%s\" \"%s\"\n", $0, tolower($0)) }'
```

#### Add line number before lines in a file
```
awk '{ print FNR ". " $0 ;next}{print}' file1
```

#### Replace the Nth occurance of a string in vim -- very useful stuff
```
:%s/\(\zsPATTERN.\{-}\)\{N}/REPLACE/
```

#### Copy based on awk in vim -- you can basically copy with delimiters - useful
```
:%!awk '{print $0" "$1}'
```

#### Get full path of all files in a directory and dump to a file. 
```
find "$PWD" > filename
```

#### Copy a file k times 
```
for i in {1..k}; do cp file "file$i"; done
```

#### Split a folder into k parts 
```
for i in `seq 1 k`; do mkdir -p "folder$i"; find . -type f -maxdepth 1 | head -n num_files_you_WANT | xargs -i mv "{}" "folder$i"; done
```

#### Speed up listing of files in a path consisting of many many files. (difference noticable after 50k files with standard ls command) 
```
ls -1f <your path>
```
For adventerous folks - compile this c code - https://github.com/ChristopherSchultz/fast-file-count
Its faster than ls -1f by about 6x on a folder containing 1 million files. Note - speedup depends on many factors such as your kernel version, operating version, gcc version -- but definitely the fast-file-count c code is faster. I have it in my home path always. 

#### du - is very slow - to get the filesize of a folder with many files - What to do?? 
[Solution - diskus](https://github.com/sharkdp/diskus)

Other solution is gdu
```
curl -L https://github.com/dundee/gdu/releases/latest/download/gdu_linux_amd64.tgz | tar xz
chmod +x gdu_linux_amd64
```
Move gdu_linux_amd64 to home path and call the following command from path you want file size. 
```
~/gdu_linux_amd64 
```

Both these tools are faster than ncdu (my previous choice to get faster than du)

### Fast Commands with gnu parallel installed (https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/parallel)

You will save a lot of time with this!!! Use parallel with rm with caution. I messed up a linux system due to this error on my personal laptop once. 

#### Convert jpeg to png in a path with parallel
Slow command
```
for i in *jpeg; do convert $i $i.png ; done
```
Fast command with parallel 
```
find . -name "*jpeg" | parallel -I% --max-args 1 convert % %.png
```

#### Run a bunch of commands - Keep all commands disjoint (any command should not depend on output of previous command)
Say you have k cores on a machine, create a file called - jobs.txt or something
Sample jobs.txt
```
command1
command2
command3
command4
and so on
```

Now with k cores run the jobs.txt file (try to run with k-1 commands in parallel)
```
parallel -- jobs k-1 < jobs.txt
```

#### Parallel copy files in linux from a given path containing many files say with 10 cores 
```
parallel -j10 cp {} output_path/ ::: *
```

#### Parallel calling with a bash script
Your bash script should have a command per line. This saves a LOT of time!!! 
```
parallel -a your-script-here.sh
```

#### Speed up file transfer from pathA (source computer) to pathB (remote computer)
Generate a transfer.log file in /tmp for all the folders/files from a source path you want to get copied
```
cat /tmp/transfer.log | parallel --will-cite -j 5 rsync -avzm --progress --relative --stats --safe-links --ignore-existing --human-readable {} dest_host:/data/ 
```

#### MacOS Homebrew upgrade - use brewski
```
alias brewski='brew update && brew upgrade && brew cleanup; brew doctor'
```
