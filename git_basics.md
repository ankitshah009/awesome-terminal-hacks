## Explanation of Key Commands

- **Branch Management**: `git branch` commands are crucial for managing multiple lines of development. Creating, listing, and deleting branches allows you to work on different features or bugs independently.
- **Checkout**: The `git checkout` command is used to switch between branches or restore files to their last committed state, making it essential for navigating and managing changes.
- **Merging and Logs**: Merging combines changes from different branches. The `git log` command provides a history, which is invaluable for tracking changes and understanding the evolution of a project.
- **Stashing**: `git stash` is useful when you need to quickly switch context without committing unfinished work, allowing for a clean working directory.
- **Tags**: Tags in Git are used to mark specific points in history as important, typically for releases. Annotated tags contain metadata such as the author, date, and message.

#### Setting up git

```sh
$ git config --global user.name "User Name"

$ git config --global user.email "email"
```

#### Applying colour to git

```sh
$ git config --global color.ui true
```

#### Checking the status of your files

The main tool you use to determine which files are in which state is the `$ git status` command. If you run this command directly after a clone, you should see something like this:

```sh
$ git status
# On branch master
nothing to commit (working directory clean)
```

If you add a new file to your project, and the file didn't exist before, when you run a `$ git status` you should see your untracked file like this:

```sh
$ git status
# On branch master
# Untracked files:
#   (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
#
#   README
nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```

#### Stashing files

Git stash is a very useful command, where git will 'hide' the changes on a dirty directory - but no worries you can re-apply them later. The command will save your local changes away and revert the working directory to match the HEAD commit.

```sh
# Stash local changes
$ git stash

# Stash local changes with a custom message
$ git stash save "this is your custom message"

# Re-apply the changes you saved in your latest stash
$ git stash apply

# Re-apply the changes you saved in a given stash number
$ git stash apply stash@{stash_number}

# Drops any stash by its number
$ git stash drop stash@{0}

# Apply the stash and then immediately drop it from your stack
$ git stash pop

# 'Release' a particular stash from your list of stashes
$ git stash pop stash@{stash_number}

# List all stashes
$ git stash list

# Show the latest stash changes
$ git stash show

# See diff details of a given stash number
$ git diff stash@{0}
```

### Basic flow to follow
#### Adding a File
```
git add <file>
```
#### Commit changes
```
git commit -m "your message"
```
Advanced users. 
```
After adding/staging a file, the next step is to commit staged file(s)
# Commit staged file(s)
$ git commit -m 'commit message'

# Add file and commit
$ git commit filename -m 'commit message'

# Add file and commit staged file
$ git commit -am 'insert commit message'

# Amending a commit
$ git commit --amend 'new commit message' or no message to maintain previous message

# Squashing commits together
$ git rebase -i
This will give you an interface on your core editor:
# Commands:
#  p, pick = use commit
#  r, reword = use commit, but edit the commit message
#  e, edit = use commit, but stop for amending
#  s, squash = use commit, but meld into previous commit
#  f, fixup = like "squash", but discard this commit's log message
#  x, exec = run command (the rest of the line) using shell

# Squashing commits together using reset --soft
$ git reset --soft HEAD~number_of_commits
$ git commit
** WARNING: this will require force pushing commits, which is OK if this is on a branch before you push to master or create a Pull Request.
```

#### Push github changes
```
git push
```
#### Always - i mean always - do a git pull - resolve conflicts before doing a git push
```sh
$ git pull origin master
```

#### Branching and merging

```sh
# Creating a local branch
$ git checkout -b branchname

# Switching between 2 branches (in fact, this would work on terminal as well to switch between 2 directories - $ cd -)
$ git checkout -

# Pushing local branch to remote
$ git push -u origin branchname

# Deleting a local branch - this won't let you delete a branch that hasn't been merged yet
$ git branch -d branchname

# Deleting a local branch - this WILL delete a branch even if it hasn't been merged yet!
$ git branch -D branchname

# Remove any remote refs you have locally that have been removed from your remote (you can substitute <origin> to any remote branch)
$ git remote prune origin

# Viewing all branches, including local and remote branches
$ git branch -a

# Viewing all branches that have been merged into your current branch, including local and remote
$ git branch -a --merged

# Viewing all branches that haven't been merged into your current branch, including local and remote
$ git branch -a --no-merged

# Viewing local branches
$ git branch

# Viewing remote branches
$ git branch -r

# Rebase master branch into local branch
$ git rebase origin/master

# Pushing local branch after rebasing master into local branch
$ git push origin +branchname
```


#### Fetching and checking out remote branches

```sh
# This will fetch all the remote branches for you.
$ git fetch origin

# With the remote branches in hand, you now need to check out the branch you are interested in, giving you a local working copy:
$ git checkout -b test origin/test

# Deleting a remote branch
$ git branch -rd origin/branchname
$ git push origin --delete branchname  or  $ git push origin:branchname
```


#### Merging branch to trunk/master

```sh
# First checkout trunk/master
$ git checkout trunk/master

# Now merge branch to trunk/master
$ git merge branchname

# To cancel a merge
$ git merge --abort
```

#### Resetting

```sh
# Mixes your head with a give sha
# This lets you do things like split a commit
$ git reset --mixed [sha]

# Upstream master
$ git reset HEAD origin/master -- filename

# The version from the most recent commit
$ git reset HEAD -- filename

# The version before the most recent commit
$ git reset HEAD^ -- filename

# Move head to specific commit
$ git reset --hard sha

# Reset the staging area and the working directory to match the most recent commit. In addition to unstaging changes, the --hard flag tells Git to overwrite all changes in the working directory, too.
$ git reset --hard
```

#### Git remote

```sh
# Show where 'origin' is pointing to and also tracked branches
$ git remote show origin

# Show where 'origin' is pointing to
$ git remote -v

# Change the 'origin' remote's URL
$ git remote set-url origin https://github.com/user/repo.git

# Add a new 'origin'
# Usually use to 'rebase' from forks
$ git remote add [NAME] https://github.com/user/fork-repo.git
```

#### Git grep

```sh
# 'Searches' for parts of strings in a directory
$ git grep 'something'

# 'Searches' for parts of strings in a directory and the -n prints out the line numbers where git has found matches
$ git grep -n 'something'

# 'Searches' for parts of string in a context (some lines before and some after the grepped term)
$ git grep -C<number of lines> 'something'

# 'Searches' for parts of string and also shows lines BEFORE the grepped term
$ git grep -B<number of lines> 'something'

# 'Searches' for parts of string and also shows lines AFTER the grepped term
$ git grep -A<number of lines> 'something'
```

#### Be nice to people before using this :) Git blame

```sh
# Show alteration history of a file with the name of the author
$ git blame [filename]

# Show alteration history of a file with the name of the author && SHA
$ git blame [filename] -l
```

#### Git log

```sh
# Show a list of all commits in a repository. This command shows everything about a commit, such as commit ID, author, date and commit message.
$ git log

# List of commits showing commit messages and changes
$ git log -p

# List of commits with the particular expression you are looking for
$ git log -S 'something'

# List of commits by author
$ git log --author 'Author Name'

# Show a list of commits in a repository in a more summarised way. This shows a shorter version of the commit ID and the commit message.
$ git log --oneline

# Show a list of commits in a repository since yesterday
$ git log --since=yesterday

# Shows log by author and searching for specific term inside the commit message
$ git log --grep "term" --author "name"
```

#### Checking what you are committing

```sh
# See all (non-staged) changes done to a local repo
$ git diff

# See all (staged) changes done to a local repo
$ git diff --cached

# Check what the changes between the files you've committed and the live repo
$ git diff --stat origin/master
```

#### Undo last commit 
Be careful using this

```
git reset --hard HEAD~1
```

#### Squash K commits into a single commit - replace 5 by k
```
git rebase -i HEAD~5git reset --soft HEAD~5
git add .
git commit -m "Update"
git push -f origin master
```

#### Useful commands

```sh
# Check if a sha is in production
$ git tag --contains [sha]

# Number of commits by author
$ git shortlog -s --author 'Author Name'

# List of authors and commits to a repository sorted alphabetically
$ git shortlog -s -n

# List of commit comments by author
$ git shortlog -n --author 'Author Name'
# This also shows the total number of commits by the author

# Number of commits by contributors
$ git shortlog -s -n

# Undo local changes to a File
$ git checkout -- filename

# Shows more detailed info about a commit
$ git cat-file sha -p

# Show number of lines added and removed from a repository by an author since some time in the past.
$ git log --author="Author name" --pretty=tformat: --numstat --since=month | awk '{ add += $1; subs += $2; loc += $1 - $2 } END { printf "added lines: %s, removed lines: %s, total lines: %s\n", add, subs, loc }'
```

#### Useful alias
To add an alias simply open your .gitconfig file on your home directory and include the alias code

```sh
# Shows the log in a more consisted way with the graph for branching and merging
lg = log --color --graph --pretty=format:'%Cred%h%Creset -%C(yellow)%d%Creset %s %Cgreen(%cr) %C(bold blue)<%an>%Creset' --abbrev-commit
```

#### Rename a tag 
```
git tag new old
git tag -d old
git push origin :refs/tags/old
git push --tags
```
